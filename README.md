# SecondLifePhotoFilter for Firestorm: Charcoal 
To be used with my sketchboard for drawing charcoal images. 
Open your Firestorm folder on your computer and drop the file "charcoal.xml" in \app_settings\filters.
Restart Firestorm to load the filter.
If you take a snapshot, you can now select "Charcoal" from the "Filters" menu. Play with your light setting for the result you want. For me "Gwen's Light" provides good results, but it all depends on your viewer's graphic settings.
Use the snapshot in your DrawingBoard.
