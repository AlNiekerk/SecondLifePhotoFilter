# SecondLifePhotoFilter for Firestorm: Charcoal 
To be used with my sketchboard for drawing charcoal images. 
Open your Firestorm folder on oyur computer, look for the folder \app_settings\filters and drop this file there.
Then restart Firestorm.
If you take a snapshot, you can select "Charcoal" from the filters now. Play with your light setting for the result you want. I found that "Gwen's Light" provides good results, but it all depends on your viewer's graphic settings.
Use the snapshot in your DrawingBoard.
