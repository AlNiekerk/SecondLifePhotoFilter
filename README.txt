# SecondLifePhotoFilter for Firestorm: Charcoal 
To be used with my sketchboard for drawing charcoal or pastel images. 
Open your Firestorm folder on your computer and drop the files "charcoal.xml" and "pastel.xml" into \app_settings\filters.
Restart Firestorm to load the filters.
If you take a snapshot, you can now select "charcoal" and "pastel" from the "Filters" menu. Play with your light setting for the result you want. For me "default" provides good results, but it all depends on your viewer's graphic settings.
Save your snapshot when you are happy with it.
Attach (add) drawing board and drawing HUD. Add the charcoal or pastel, depending on what style you want to draw. (You receive the HUD and the drawing utensils if you click the clip of your drawing board.)
Drag the snapshot from your inventory to the HUD of your drawing board.
Click your drawing board to draw. 
Have fun!
